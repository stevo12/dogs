I've opted for a MVVM+ approach with Clean Architecture.
I've decided to use OrbitMvi library because due to its structured and simple components

This approach is modular and easy to use. Plug & Play.

# Libraries used:
 - OrbitMvi for clean state handling and structure 
 - Moshi and OkHttp for the networking layer
 - HILT for dependency injection
 - Jetpack Compose for UI
 - Coroutines for async operations(used by the libraries mentioned above)
 - Coil for async image loading
